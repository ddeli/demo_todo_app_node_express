# README

This is a yet non-persistent implementation of a ToDo list for demo and learning purpose.

The app in this repo is deployed at [https://demo-todo-list-node-express.onrender.com/](https://demo-todo-list-node-express.onrender.com/).

## Deployment

See https://render.com/docs/deploy-node-express-app or follow the steps below:

Create a new web service with the following values:
  * Build Command: `yarn`
  * Start Command: `node app.js`

That's it! Your web service will be live on your Render URL as soon as the build finishes.

Free Render instance types will spin down with inactivity. So it could take a while until the App is displayed.
